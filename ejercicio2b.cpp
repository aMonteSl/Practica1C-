Goal: Exercise 2b instructs writing a program to print numbers from 1 to 4 on the same line, with each pair of adjacent numbers separated by a space.
Specifically, for part b, it asks to achieve this using a single statement with four stream insertion operators.
---------------------------- */

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Print the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the same line with spaces using four insertion stream operators.
    std::cout << "1 " << "2 " << "3 " << "4\n";

    return 0;
}
